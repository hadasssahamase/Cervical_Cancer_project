    "OBJECTIVES\n",
    "\n",
    "** Main Business Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce cervical cancer-related mortality and diagnostic delays by providing a low-cost, AI-powered screening and triage tool that supports early detection and referral decisions, especially in low-resource healthcare settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To Develop a user-friendly, AI-powered triage tool that helps community health workers identify high-risk cervical cancer cases using simple inputs like symptoms and risk history.\n",
    "2. To Enable explainable and evidence-based AI recommendations that support clinician decision-making and build trust in low-resource settings.\n",
    "3. To Demonstrate a functional and scalable MVP that balances machine learning performance, usability, and ethical health AI practices.\n",
    "4. To Show measurable potential for reducing diagnostic delays and missed cervical cancer cases in underserved populations.\n",
    "5. To Position CervAI as an investable digital health solution with application in rural outreach programs, NGO deployments, and government-led screening initiatives.\n",
    "6. To Empower women and families with accessible screening support, especially where access to labs or specialists is limited.\n",
    "7. To Improve awareness of cervical cancer symptoms and risk factors by integrating educational prompts and explanations into the toolâ€™s interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. To Identify key predictive patterns and correlations between clinical risk factors and cervical cancer diagnoses to inform AI model design.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. To Uncover demographic or behavioral trends (e.g., age, pregnancies, screening history) that influence cervical cancer risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To Quantify the prevalence of high-risk symptoms (e.g., irregular bleeding, HPV history) in the dataset to support early triage criteria."
